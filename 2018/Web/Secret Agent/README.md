# Solution
When attempting to view the flag, I got an error message about how I wasn't
google. So I did a quick search on "how to browse as google" and was able to
find a [bot simulator](http://www.botsimulator.com/) website that allows you to
browse a page as a google bot. I pasted in the url and it gave me the flag.
