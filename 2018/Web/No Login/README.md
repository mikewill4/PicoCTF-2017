# No Login
## Description
>Looks like someone started making a website but never got around to making a login, but I heard there was a flag if you were the admin. http://2018shell.picoctf.com:14664
## Solution
This time the site is looking in your cookies for an admin cookie to tell it if
you are the admin. Add an admin cookie with the value set to true and you will
get the flag. Flag: picoCTF{n0l0g0n_n0_pr0bl3m_eb9bab29}
