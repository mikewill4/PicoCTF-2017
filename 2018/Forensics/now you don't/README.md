# Solution
This flag is actually hidden in plain sight. In order to find the flag, you have
to play around with hue, saturation, lightness, brightness, and/or contrast
values. With the following values I was able to reveal the flag:
* Hue: 72
* Saturation: -100
* Lightness: 22
* Brightness: -36
* Contrast: 39
