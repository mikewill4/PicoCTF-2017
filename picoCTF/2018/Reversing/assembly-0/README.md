# assembly-0
## Description
>What does asm0(0xb6,0xc6) return? Submit the flag as a hexadecimal value (starting with '0x'). NOTE: Your submission for this question will NOT be in the normal flag format.
## Solution
This is some pretty basic assembly. Essentially it takes the arguments passed in
and just returns the second argument. So for the arguments 0xb6 and 0xc6, the
flag would be 0xc6.
