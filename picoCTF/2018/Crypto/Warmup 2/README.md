# Crypto Warmup 2
## Description
>Cryptography doesn't have to be complicated, have you ever heard of something called rot13? cvpbPGS{guvf_vf_pelcgb!}
## Solution
The problem hints at a rot13 shift cipher. This is pretty easy to decode online, especially knowing the shift. I went to [decode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) and it gave me the flag: picoCTF{this_is_crypto!}
