# Binary Exploitation (Level 1): Bash Loop
## Description: 
>We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers...Go to /problems/bd058e83a119c78a006543d23d9f6422 and try it out!
## Solution:
The challenge involves manipulating a number guessing programmin g. Since the title is "Bash Loop", I figured that I would need to write a simple loop in bash to produce certain input. First, I navigated to the problem directory and played around with the program.
***
    $ ./bash_loop
    What number am I thinking of? It is between 0 and 4096
***
The program appeared to want some input, so I tried passing in a random number. 
***
    $ ./bash_loop 1234
    Nope. Pick another number between 0 and 4096
***
Perfect! All we need to do is create a simple bash loop to print all of the numbers (0-4096) to standard out and then feed it to the program. 
***
    $ for i in {0..4096}; do ./bashloop $i; done | grep flag
    Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: d3aaad36e3947ceed96a916ca92d33b4
***
Therefore, flag is: `d3aaad36e3947ceed96a916ca92d33b4`
