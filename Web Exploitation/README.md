# Web Exploitation (Level 1): What Is Web
## Description: 
>Someone told me that some guy came up with the "World Wide Web", using "HTML" and "stuff" Can you help me figure out what that is? Website.
## Solution:
The challenge provides a link to a website, so I followed the link, opened up developer tools, and immediately saw this in Elements... 
***
    <!-- Cool! Look at me! This is an HTML file. It describes what each page contains in a format your browser can understand. -->
    <!-- The first part of the flag (there are 3 parts) is 8d96c7d8966 -->
    <!-- What other types of files are there in a webpage? -->
***
I then continued searching through the files in developer tools and was able to find the following in hacker.css and script.js.
***
    The second part of the flag is 8106eabacc0
    The final part of the flag is 3b680682297
***
Put it all together: `8d96c7d89668106eabacc03b680682297`
