# Misc (Level 1): Leaf of the Tree
## Description: 
>We found this annoyingly named directory tree starting at /problems/10f7c1d3e9fa2d4fc95555530ea97ec5.It would be pretty lame to type out all of those directory names but maybe there is something in there worth finding? And maybe we dont need to type out all those names...? Follow the trunk, using cat and ls!
## Solution:
The description says it all! In the webshell, cd into /problems/10f7c1d3e9fa2d4fc95555530ea97ec5. Then type cd trunk and continue to tab complete until there is no trunk directory. At this point you should be in the directory with the flag!
***
    $ cat flag
    88636e09e72bafb444e7f6a8105dbc5d
***
Therefore, flag is: 88636e09e72bafb444e7f6a8105dbc5d
