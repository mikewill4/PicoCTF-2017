## Description: 
I was told there was something at IP shell2017.picoctf.com with port 58626. How do I get there? Do I need a ship for the port?
## Solution:
We are given a domain and port, so we can pretty easily open up a webshell with netcat.
***
`$ nc shell2017.picoctf.com 58626 \*\*\* Yay! You made it!`
***
`Take a flag!`
***
`86c3b6dc83b85a2e67f0c163dd525cb0`
***
Therefore, flag is: 86c3b6dc83b85a2e67f0c163dd525cb0
